# form_to_email_app

In many client-facing departments, staff can be expected to compose their own correspondence to the client to inform them of updates to the processing of a case.

This often results in:

1. An inconsistent experience for the end user, as different members of staff have different typing styles or different interpretations of what is 'formal'.
2. Penalising of staff for not processing enough cases due to having slow typing speeds or low confidence in composing messages in this context.
3. Reduced performance as staff time is wasted deciding what to type and not actually serving the client.
4. Errors are introduced (such as grammar or spelling mistakes).

All of the above are categorised as Process Waste, as they are related to what is accepted as the standard way of doing things.

Oher aspects of the process could be improved but due to issues with resource (that is, there wasn't any) I developed this app as an interim solution to take the stress and unnecessary burden off of the staff, while enabling a consistent experience for the end user. It took a few hours to develop and was implemented within 24 hours. Any changes required can be made and rolled out in minutes as I worked very closely with the servicing teams. They would quite often just come up to my desk and request updates or ask questions. That's one of the reasons why I like being in the office.

TLDR

This app is just a simple form with a little validation that collects the required datapoints and inserts them dynamically into an email, composed in the default email client of the end user. The code has some comments but it is simple enough to get around without them. You are free to take it and adapt it as you wish. Hopefully it makes your life easier!
